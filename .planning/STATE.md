## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Auth and cost controls must be in place before any AI API code (safety-first ordering)
- [Roadmap]: Pipeline built in vertical layers (crawl -> generate -> dispatch -> analyze -> score) not horizontal layers
- [Roadmap]: Competitive intelligence and brand analysis depend on core audit, not on each other (phases 6 and 7 can run after phase 5)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Verify current AI provider API pricing before Phase 1 cost modeling
- [Research]: Verify Perplexity API model names (sonar) are still current
- [Research]: Review provider TOS for output storage before Phase 1 schema design
- [Codebase]: Six existing concerns from CONCERNS.md must be resolved in Phase 1 (disabled auth, .env committed, rate limiter fails open, BackgroundTasks instead of Celery, random number fallbacks, dual ORM)
